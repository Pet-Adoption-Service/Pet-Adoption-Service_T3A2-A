## **R1 - Description of your website**
A platform for individuals and families to browse and adopt animals from cats, dogs and other animals in need of a new home. Users can search based on breed, gender, size, age and many more. The website will contain photos, information about each animal and application processes to adopt a new animal.
Further information can be found either through the FAQ page or after booking a visit to see our friendly staff for assistance with our furry friends. We aim to provide the best possible information once you have submitted a ticket.
